<p> Hi world, my name is Jason VonGerichten, I'm 6'4", I weigh two cough cough pounds, I'm forty cough years old, my dogs names are Sushi and Cookie, I've been married for 18 years, and I once held the door open for William Shatner and under my breath I made a whooch sound like the doors make on the Enterprise. </p>
<p> I've always thought it was bad grammar when someone's middle initial is A and their last name begins with a vowel. Sarah A Anderson? It should be Sarah An Anderson. </p>
