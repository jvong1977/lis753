                <h2>Give me a G.O.B.!</h2>
                <p> <a href=https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/G.O.B">G.O.B.</a> is the self-absorbed older brother to Michael Bluth and is a main character of Arrested Development. A social peacock, G.O.B. exudes a certain type of showmanship at all times, perhaps best illustrated by his favorite mode of transportation: his trusty Segway. Once a highly respected magician and founder of The Alliance of Magicians, G.O.B. fell from grace when the TV news revealed the secret to his illusion.</p>

            <p>George Bluth paid little attention to G.O.B. as a child and has no respect for him as an adult, but has always said that he was the child with charm, and likes him more than Lucille does, and more so than Buster. G.O.B.'s mother Lucille openly loathes him and only calls on him to do her dirty work, though they occasionally see eye to eye on minor things and share a laugh. On several occasions, G.O.B. and Michael <q>eat my p---y</q> Bluth realized that their rivalry has been nurtured by their father and mother's manipulations. They actually kind of like each other as brothers when they aren't at each other's throats, and G.O.B. seems to desire Michael's love and approval more than he does from his own parents. Michael is always afraid that G.O.B.'s antics will rub off on George Michael, whom G.O.B. has asked to do questionable tasks in the past. When G.O.B. is tasked to send George Michael away from him, he is genuinely upset but does so out of respect for Michael. His Uncle Oscar, while they do not interact often, respects the man more than either of his parents, believing that G.O.B. has actual magical abilities and once told Lucille that he can handle more than any of them believe, much to her confusion.</p>
            <h2>Come on!</h2>
            <p>G.O.B. has always acted like a bully to his younger brother Buster because he didn't respect him. Buster eventually earned his respect on a construction site. ("Staff Infection") This didn't entirely stop G.O.B. from mocking him, but both are moved to tears of happiness when they build a Tiny Town together through a surrogate which initially led G.O.B. to believe that he was building it with George Sr. G.O.B. is also genuinely horrified by his brother losing a hand.</p>
