                <h2>The most important thing...</h2>
                <p> Residing in Newport Beach, California, the <a href="https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Bluth_family">Bluths</a> became an affluent family due to real estate mogul George Bluth, Sr.'s formation of the Bluth Company.</p>

            <p>Together with his wife Lucille Bluth, they welcomed two sons into the world: George Oscar "G.O.B." Bluth and Michael Bluth. They also adopted Lindsay at age three. Lucille mothered Byron "Buster" Bluth and the supposed father is George's twin brother Oscar Bluth. Decades later, Lucille and George adopted a Korean child, Annyong Bluth.</p>
            <h2>Hermano?</h2>
            <p>Lindsay married Tobias Funke as an act of rebellion and together they, with the help of science, conceived Mae "Maeby" Funke. Michael married his college sweetheart Tracy Bluth and had a son, George Michael Bluth. G.O.B. fooled around a lot and fathered at least one known son, Steve Holt. G.O.B. briefly was married to an unnamed woman.</p>
            <h2>Go see a Star War.</h2>
            <p>Other than the immediate family, other family members have been mentioned and seen. Lucille is mentioned having a deceased, unnamed, mother ("Nana"), as well as a sister, whom George slept with. A family friend, Jack Dorso, is referred to as "Uncle Jack", or "Fake Uncle Jack". G.O.B.'s puppet Franklin Delano Bluth is often considered a member of the family.</p>
