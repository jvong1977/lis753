                <p> G.O.B states that he began his magic career to get out of gym class. ("A New Attitude") By the early 2000s, he was a major player in the magician scene having founded The Alliance of Magicians, which had the primary function of insisting society take performing magicians seriously. He was later kicked out of the Alliance when in 2003 reporter Trisha Thoon revealed on television how his Aztec Tomb illusion worked. ("Pilot") He attempted to be re-admitted into the Alliance by impressing them with a series of illusions (some of which were also done with the additional purpose of getting featured in Poof Magazine). This string of illusions included the Prison escape illusion, ("Visiting Ours") a Saw the lady in half illusion, ("Storming the Castle") a Disappearing yacht illusion, ("Missing Kitty") a magic coffin illusion, ("Good Grief") The Sword of Destiny illusion, ("Sword of Destiny") a Free Chicken Illusion, ("For British Eyes Only") and Jesus' crucifixion illusion. ("Colony Collapse")</p>

            <h2>Tricks are what a whore does for money.</h2>
            <p>G.O.B. is always prepared to perform or, more accurately, unsuccessfully attempt a card trick or other form of magic such as pulling a live dove out of his pants, shooting pennies into a crowd, or shooting a fireball (nearly exclusively unignited lighter fluid). He has a penchant for using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw">The Final Countdown by Europe</a> in his magic acts.</p>
